# Spotify Fellowship Application
Answers for application

##### Some pointers
These solutions were written in `node.js` and "unit-tests" are just simple `console.logs()`.
I wasn't sure if using node's implicit assertion library was acceptable for the application so I kept my answers inside `console.log()`.

To run: `node {filename.js}`
